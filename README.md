# Strava Summer 2017 Stats
> One-off script for calculating my biking stats for summer of 2017 using the Strava API

I interned at [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) during the summer of 2017. Since I recorded all my outdoor activities with Strava, I thought it would be cool to interface with their public API and calculate a summary of my summer spent in the Bay Area.
